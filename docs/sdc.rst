Susceptibility Distortion Correction (SDC)
------------------------------------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

:abbr:`SDC (susceptibility-derived distortion correction)` methods usually try to
make a good estimate of the field inhomogeneity map. 
The inhomogeneity map is directly related to the displacement of 
a given pixel :math:`(x, y, z)` along the
:abbr:`PE (phase-encoding)` direction (:math:`d_\text{PE}(x, y, z)`) is
proportional to the slice readout time (:math:`T_\text{ro}`)
and the field inhomogeneity (:math:`\Delta B_0(x, y, z)`)
as follows ([Jezzard1995]_, [Hutton2002]_):

  .. _eq_fieldmap:

  .. math::

      d_\text{PE}(x, y, z) = \gamma \Delta B_0(x, y, z) T_\text{ro} \qquad (1) 


where :math:`\gamma` is the gyromagnetic ratio. Therefore, the
displacements map :math:`d_\text{PE}(x, y, z)` can be estimated
either via estimating the inhomogeneity map :math:`\Delta B_0(x, y, z)`
(:ref:`sdc_phasediff` and :ref:`sdc_direct_b0`) or
via image registration (:ref:`sdc_pepolar`, :ref:`sdc_fieldmapless`).


Correction methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The are five broad families of methodologies for mapping the field:

  1. :ref:`sdc_pepolar` (also called **blip-up/blip-down**):
     acquire at least two images with varying :abbr:`PE (phase-encoding)` directions.
     Hence, the realization of distortion is different between the different
     acquisitions. The displacements map :math:`d_\text{PE}(x, y, z)` is
     estimated with an image registration process between the different
     :abbr:`PE (phase-encoding)` acquisitions, regularized by the
     readout time :math:`T_\text{ro}`.
     Corresponds to 8.9.4 of BIDS.

  2. :ref:`sdc_direct_b0`: some sequences (such as :abbr:`SE (spiral echo)`)
     are able to measure the fieldmap :math:`\Delta B_0(x, y, z)` directly.
     Corresponds to section 8.9.3 of BIDS.

  3. :ref:`sdc_phasediff`: to estimate the fieldmap :math:`\Delta B_0(x, y, z)`,
     these methods   measure the phase evolution in time between two close
     :abbr:`GRE (Gradient Recall Echo)` acquisitions. Corresponds to the sections
     8.9.1 and 8.9.2 of the BIDS specification.

  4. :ref:`sdc_fieldmapless`: FMRIPREP now experimentally supports displacement
     field estimation in the absence of fieldmaps via nonlinear registration.

  5. **Point-spread function acquisition**: Not supported by FMRIPREP.


In order to select the appropriate estimation workflow, the input BIDS dataset is
first queried to find the available field-mapping techniques (see :ref:`sdc_base`).
Once the field-map (or the corresponding displacement field) is estimated, the 
distortion can be accounted for (see :ref:`sdc_unwarp`).



Calculating the effective echo-spacing and total-readout time
.............................................................

To solve :ref:`(1) <eq_fieldmap>`, all methods (with the exception of the
fieldmap-less approach) will require information about the in-plane
speed of the :abbr:`EPI (echo-planar imaging)` scheme used in 
acquisition by reading either the :math:`T_\text{ro}` 
(total-readout time) or :math:`t_\text{ees}` (effective echo-spacing):
